create a new branch:
    git branch hello-world-images

(Now we created a new branch called "hello-world-images"

Let's confirm that we have created a new branch:
    git branch)

Output:
            hello-world-images
        * master

(We can see the new branch with the name "hello-world-images", but the * beside master specifies that we are currently on that branch.

checkout is the command used to check out a branch. Moving us from the current branch, to the one specified at the end of the command:)

    git checkout hello-world-images

(Switched to branch 'hello-world-images')
